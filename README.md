🚀 Cloud-Native Multi-App Platform on AWS (Laravel + Django + React)

This repository demonstrates a complete production-grade system design where
AWS infrastructure is provisioned using Terraform, and multiple applications are deployed and run on Kubernetes (AWS EKS).

The platform supports running the following applications together:

✅ Laravel (PHP backend)
✅ Django (Python backend)
✅ React (Frontend application)

It also includes:

GitLab CI/CD (test → build → push → deploy)

Monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana

Logging using Loki, Promtail, and AWS CloudWatch
